## Brzozowski Derivatives

J.A. Brzozowski **Derivatives of regular expressions**, *J. ACM*, 11 (1964), pp. 481-494, [https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/321239.321249](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/321239.321249).

Brzozowski derivatives give a deterministic interpretation of regular expressions.
The Brzozowski construction is a DFA-like symbolic interpretation of regular expressions.

## Antimirov Derivatives

Valentin Antimirov, **Partial derivatives of regular expressions and finite automaton constructions**,
*Theoretical Computer Science*, Volume 155, Issue 2, 1996, Pages 291-319, ISSN 0304-3975,
[https://doi.org/10.1016/0304-3975(95)00182-4](https://doi.org/10.1016/0304-3975(95)00182-4).

Antimirov partial derivatives give a non-deterministic interpretation of regular expressions.
The Antimirov construction is an NFA-like symbolic interpretation of regular expressions.

## Pointed Regular Expressions

Andrea Asperti, Claudio Sacerdoti Coen, Enrico Tassi, **Regular Expressions, au point**, 2010, [arXiv:1010.2604](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1010.2604).

Pointed regular expressions provide an
algebraic counterpart to position automata, joining the elegance and the
symbolic appealingness of Brzozowski’s derivatives, with the effectiveness of McNaughton and Yamada’s labelling technique, and essentially
combining the best of the two approaches
