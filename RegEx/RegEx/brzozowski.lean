 We require decidable equality for 𝒜 (`DecidableEq 𝒜`).
 Technically, the only thing needed is a function that checks
 if a character `c` is in the set `t` captured by the token constructor `τ t`
 Equality is a particular case, in which the set `t` is a singleton.
 **TODO**:
 - I keep DecidableEq initially to have the first run at the proofs,
 - then I'll try to remove this constraint.
 - So in the end we will require of a letter 𝒜 in the token-type 𝒯 `Membership 𝓐 𝒯`,
`Membership 𝓐 𝒯` will give us symbolic Regex, where the token will encode a set of letters, with equality as a particular case.

 The correctness theorem has the form that
  The language of the derivative (`L (D c r)`) and the derivative of the language (`D c (L r)`) are the same.
  We will approach the proof by induction on the structure of the Regex r.
  Then for each case we unfold the derivative and retrieve the denotation from ℒ.
  Now in the language world we simply use the lemmas defined for languages.
